# AGENTS

- Run `src/setup.ts` to (re)create symlinks for scripts. Add new scripts here as needed
- when making a new script try using `src/utils/createScript.ts`
- use `yargs` for arg management, always use `.strict()` arg parsing and proper reasonable arg types
- if interactivity is desired see how other scripts in this repo do it and use the same libs
